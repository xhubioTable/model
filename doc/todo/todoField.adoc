== TodoField Documentation

The `TodoField` represents a todo item for handling static field values. It corresponds to a value specified in the generator column and is typically used for multi-row fields in test case data. This documentation covers the interfaces and class that define and implement this functionality.

=== TodoFieldInterface

Defines the structure for a todo item related to static field values. It extends the base todo interface and includes the following properties:
* **key**: The value provided in the "key" column.
* **comment**: The comment or annotation provided in the "comment" column.
* **other**: Additional information provided in the "other" column.

=== TodoFieldOptions

Specifies the options used to create a `TodoField` instance. In addition to the base properties inherited from the todo base options, it includes:
* **key**: The static value from the "key" column.
* **comment**: The comment or annotation from the "comment" column.
* **other**: Additional information from the "other" column.

=== Class: TodoField

The `TodoField` class is an implementation of the static field todo item. It extends the base todo functionality (provided by `TodoBase`) and implements the `TodoFieldInterface`. The class encapsulates the properties needed to handle static data values, including:
* **key**: The static value.
* **comment**: The comment or annotation.
* **other**: Additional information.

The constructor initializes these properties using the provided options.

=== Example Usage

[source, typescript]
----
import { TodoField } from './TodoField'

const options = {
  fieldName: 'exampleField',
  testcaseMeta: {
    fileName: 'test.xlsx',
    tableName: 'Test Table',
    tableType: 'decision-table',
    testcaseName: 'TestCase1'
  },
  key: 'staticKey',
  comment: 'This is a comment for the static field',
  other: 'Additional info'
}

const todoField = new TodoField(options)
console.log(todoField)
----

=== Summary

The `TodoField` component is essential for representing static data values in test case generation. It provides a structured way to capture and process static values along with their associated comments and additional details. This helps ensure that static field data is managed consistently across test cases.
