== Table Interface Documentation

The `TableInterface` defines the abstract representation of a table. It is designed to support various types of tables such as decision tables, matrix tables, etc. This interface provides properties to hold the table’s metadata and methods to retrieve and process test case definitions.

=== Properties

* **fileName**  
  The file name from which the table is loaded.

* **tableName**  
  The human-readable name of the table.

* **logger**  
  The logger instance used for logging operations related to the table.

* **tableMeta**  
  Read-only meta-information about the table (e.g., origin, descriptive details).

* **tableType**  
  Read-only string identifier representing the type of the table (e.g., "decision-table", "matrix-table").

=== Methods

==== getTestcaseForName

[source, typescript]
----
getTestcaseForName(testcaseName: string): TestcaseDefinitionInterface
----
Retrieves the test case definition for a given test case name.  
*Parameters:*  
- `testcaseName` – The name of the test case to retrieve.  
*Returns:*  
- The test case definition corresponding to the provided name.  
*Throws:*  
- An error if the test case cannot be found.

==== getTestcasesForExecution

[source, typescript]
----
getTestcasesForExecution(): Generator<TestcaseDefinitionInterface, void, unknown>
----
A generator function that yields all test case definitions intended for execution.  
This method allows the caller to iterate over each test case defined in the table.

==== processRanges

[source, typescript]
----
processRanges(rangeName: string): string[]
----
Parses a test case name or range and returns an array of individual test case names.  
For example, a range name such as "tc12-14" is expanded to:
["tc12", "tc13", "tc14"].  
*Parameters:*  
- `rangeName` – The test case name or range to parse.  
*Returns:*  
- An array of test case names.

=== Summary

The `TableInterface` serves as a foundational contract for table implementations. It encapsulates essential properties, such as metadata and logging, and defines key methods for accessing test case definitions and processing test case ranges. This interface enables consistent handling of various table types across the application.
